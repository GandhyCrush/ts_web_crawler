# Web Crawler Exercise

This is a code exercise made by Gandhy GarcÃ­a for Stack Builders.

This code is structured as a mini app with a frontend and backend components.

This app crawls the "https://news.ycombinator.com/" website and shows the relevant information of a certain number of entries. It also allows the user to filter the results.

2. **Install the dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the backend server (with fastapi)**

   ```
   fastapi dev main.py
